I am **Pafča**, I have been working as Customer Support Lead.  I like the fact that I can help to people and make them happy due to solving their issues.  My big passion in last years is exploring the programming language Python, HTML, CSS.  I really love when I can create some tools that  will help to automate daily routines of my colleagues.
